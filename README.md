What is Colour Detection?

Colour detection is the process of detecting the name of any color. 
Human eyes and brains work together to translate light into color. Light receptors that are present in our eyes transmit the signal to the brain. 
Our brain then recognizes the color. Since childhood, we have mapped certain lights with their color names. We will be using the somewhat same strategy to detect color names.

About the  Project

In this color detection Python project, we are going to build an application through which you can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them.
Colors are made up of 3 primary colors; red, green, and blue. In computers, we define each color value within a range of 0 to 255. 
We will be using a dataset that contains RGB values with their corresponding names which is in the form of csv file. 
OpenCV, Pandas, and numpy are the Python packages that are necessary for this project in Python.
